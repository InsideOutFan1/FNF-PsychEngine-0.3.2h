# Psych 0.3.2h with Android features for mod ports

Tried my best to make it more vanilla but I really can't because I removed a couple of things:

- Events
- Lua stuff (0.3.2h lua, not really important I guess)
- Achievements (I personally dont like them)

You can add these again in your fork or repo if you want
