# Psych 0.3.2h with Android features for mod ports

[![buildAndroid](https://github.com/SanicBTW/FNF-PE-0.3.2h/actions/workflows/Android.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/SanicBTW/FNF-PE-0.3.2h/actions/workflows/Android.yml)

The latest commit adds compiling flags for those who want to remove the Storage Access feature completely without breaking the code accidentally

Tried my best to make it more vanilla but I really can't because I removed a couple of things:

Lua stuff (0.3.2h lua, not really important I guess)

Story Menu State (who uses this though)

Achievements (I personally dont like them)

You can add these again in your fork or repo if you want
