# Psych 0.3.2h with Android features for mod ports

Tried my best to make it more vanilla but I really can't because I removed a couple of things:

- Lua stuff (0.3.2h lua, not really important I guess)
- Story Menu State (who uses this though)
- Achievements (I personally dont like them)
- Reset score substate

You can add these again in your fork or repo if you want
