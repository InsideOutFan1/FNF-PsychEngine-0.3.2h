# Psych 0.3.2h with Android features for mod ports

Stuff gone:

- Lua stuff (0.3.2h lua, not really important I guess)
- Achievements (I personally dont like them)

You can add these again in your fork if you want

Pending stuff:

- Finish song issue:
- - When finishing song it will take some time to change the song (a lot of time)
- - Plays the last song instead of the next one (tested week 3, played pico then blammed)

Special thanks:

HTML5 Players - For testing latest changes

Dulce - For beta testing the Android version (<3)
