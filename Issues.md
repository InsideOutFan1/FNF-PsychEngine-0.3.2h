# Current issues

- Lime 8.0.0 seems to have issues with rendering sometimes (Some stuff like FlxText's might seem a little bit more pixelated)

- HTML5 only shows hud elements but on sys targets it works fine, looking into it (no section hit either)

- Downscroll

- When switching back and coming back to game, FPS are capped to 60 (mobile)
